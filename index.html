<h2> <b>Short biography</b> </h2>
<p><b>Janakpur</b>, the historic capital of the ancient <B>Mithila Kingdom</b>, stands as a premier spiritual and cultural landmark in the Terai plains of Nepal. Established during the Vedic period and ruled by the philosopher-king Janak, the city is immortalized in the Ramayana as the <u>birthplace of Goddess Sita</u> and the site of her divine marriage to<b> Lord Ram</B>. This storied past is physically anchored by the breathtaking Janaki Mandir, <u>a massive white-marble masterpiece completed in 1911 by Queen Vrisha Bhanu of Tikamgarh</u>. Often called the <i>"Nau Lakha Mandir"</i> due to its original cost of nine lakh rupees, <u>the temple’s fusion of Mughal and Rajput architecture makes it a rare visual icon that draws hundreds of thousands of pilgrims annually</u>, especially during the grand wedding reenactment of<i> Vivah Panchami</i>.
